Body Fat Percentage Predictor
This is a simple web application built with Streamlit that predicts a user's estimated body fat percentage based on daily health metrics such as weight, calorie intake, protein intake, sleep duration, and steps walked.

🔍 Project Overview
The app uses a machine learning model trained on a mock dataset simulating 90 days of health and fitness data. It demonstrates how regression models can be applied in fitness-related predictions.
